===============================
Create bot account in Launchpad
===============================

1. Request an email alias (and mappings to real email).
   This requires filing an RT ticket
   (e.g: `RT#c162471 <https://portal.admin.canonical.com/C162471/>`_)
   with details about:

   - The alias email address.

   - Which emails addresses the alias maps to.
   
   In doubt, ask the Launchpad team about it.

2. Create SSO account using the email alias (every real email mapped will get
   the Ubuntu One emails with the link to validate the email).

   **Note:** in case multiple users have access to this email alias,
   anyone with access to the email alias will be able to reset the
   password of this account.

3. While still logged in with the new SSO account, go to https://launchpad.net
   and click login.
